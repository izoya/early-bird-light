# Early Bird Light
My personal carefully crafted IntelliJ IDEA color scheme.

I believe it started with the Classic Light with addition of hues and font variants to make code syntax easily distinguishable while keeping overall experience calm and collected.

Ideal for occasional sun glare on your screen and for early morning birds like myself.
